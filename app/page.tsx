                razor-sharp reflection of our accelerating world, where tech,
                ethics, and ego collide. It&apos;s about the thrill of creation,
                the fear of losing control, and the uneasy realization that the
                future might already be slipping from our grasp. A provocative
                and deeply human drama, Doomers asks: can we survive the
                technologies we&apos;ve unleashed? And should we even want to?

                <span className="font-accent text-accent">Matthew Gasda</span>{" "}
                has emerged as one of New York&apos;s most innovative theatrical
                voices, creating immersive productions that transform
                unconventional spaces into intimate stages for contemporary
                drama. As playwright-in-residence at the Brooklyn Center for
                Theater Research, which he co-founded, Gasda has garnered
                attention for works like &quot;Dimes Square&quot; (2022) and
                &quot;Zoomers&quot; (2023)â€”plays that range from razor-sharp
                social satire to deeply felt family drama, earning acclaim for
                their nuanced exploration of life across generations. His latest
                work, &quot;Doomers&quot; (2024), tackles the cultural and
                philosophical implications of artificial intelligence,
                demonstrating his ability to capture watershed moments in
                contemporary society.
