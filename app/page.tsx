            is a razor-sharp reflection of our accelerating world, where tech,
            ethics, and ego collide. It&apos;s about the thrill of creation, the
            fear of losing control, and the uneasy realization that the future
            might already be slipping from our grasp. A provocative and deeply
            human drama, Doomers asks: can we survive the technologies
            we&apos;ve unleashed? And should we even want to?

              Matthew Gasda
            </span>{" "}
            has emerged as one of New York&apos;s most innovative theatrical
            voices, creating immersive productions that transform unconventional
            spaces into intimate stages for contemporary drama. As
            playwright-in-residence at the Brooklyn Center for Theater Research,
            which he co-founded, Gasda has garnered attention for works like
            &quot;Dimes Square&quot; (2022) and &quot;Zoomers&quot; (2023)â€”plays
            that range from razor-sharp social satire to deeply felt family
            drama, earning acclaim for their nuanced exploration of life across
            generations. His latest work, &quot;Doomers&quot; (2024), tackles
            the cultural and philosophical implications of artificial
            intelligence, demonstrating his ability to capture watershed moments
            in contemporary society.
