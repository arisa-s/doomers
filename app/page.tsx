                Doomers is a razor-sharp reflection of our accelerating world,
                where tech, ethics, and ego collide. It&apos;s about the thrill
                of creation, the fear of losing control, and the uneasy
                realization that the future might already be slipping from our
                grasp. A provocative and deeply human drama, Doomers asks: can
                we survive the technologies we&apos;ve unleashed? And should we

              <p className="text-primary leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Matthew Gasda has emerged as one of New York&apos;s most
                innovative theatrical voices, creating immersive productions
                that transform unconventional spaces into intimate stages for
                contemporary drama. As playwright-in-residence at the Brooklyn
                Center for Theater Research, which he co-founded, Gasda has
                garnered attention for works like &quot;Dimes Square&quot;
                (2022) and &quot;Zoomers&quot; (2023)—plays that range from
                razor-sharp social satire to deeply felt family drama, earning
                acclaim for their nuanced exploration of life across
                generations. His latest work, &quot;Doomers&quot; (2024),
                tackles the cultural and philosophical implications of
                artificial intelligence, demonstrating his ability to capture
                watershed moments in contemporary society.
